# Power-Bi-_
The first document GDP, and the data is cleaned then the visualization is done to get insights on the countries' GDP. Using this insight, other plans in terms of investments can be made using this information.
## In merging sheets, you should use two unique rows in the instance that the data in them is not the same
- Pivotig can only be done on two columns
## Fact dimension model 
- This makes the operation faster - they are ordered in transaction tables made up of dimensions that are static tables
### Other contexts covered
- Merge cells, create index column, create a column, merge cells
- Cardinality data and how to choose based on the data which one suits the project 
- Use of tables to carry out the calculations including COUNT(DISTINCT) etc which will be used to obtain the data, don't summarize etc
- difference between visualization tools and the use of tables
- the table, one can be also able to edit
- The mode of aggregation can be changed in the value setting
- every data in the table can be formatted using conditional formatting
- select setting to show just the bars
- visuals iN data using symbols on the charts
- Pie charts - used for showing a percentage (Most commonly used ) Only use it if there is 100%
- Tooltips is used to give additional information
- use of slicers to filter the year data

in visualization when creating slicers, the filter pane after the visualizations pane, should be used to filter the blanks and null sections in the slier. There are three types of filtering namely:
* Basic filtering - normal
* Advanced filtering
* ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f46b41d3-99e4-4fdc-bd23-9a6e0b5db662)
* Top N - top values
  - how to change the slicer - horizontal 
- Removing interactions between the visualization, highlight or filter
- ### Syncing the slicers in different pages-- use the sync slicers section to enable both pages to have th filter activated
- The advanced filter enables the settings to be adapted immediately for syncronisation 
- ### Drill down enables one to zoom within the regions
- Expand all down enables the data to be narrown b etter than drill
- #### Drill through -
